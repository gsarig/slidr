"The plugin contains the <code>slidr_loop()</code> function, which allows you "
"to use your own custom loop instead of the plugin's parameters. That means "
"that you can keep all the existing functionality of the carousel, but the "
"content with which you will fill it is entirely up to you. For example, you "
"could create a carousel displaying videos, instagram photos or any other "
"content that you wish to format in a particular way. Your custom loop can be "
"a typical foreach() php loop and the only thing you need to do is adding the "
"<code>slidr-item</code> class to the container of each of your loop's items. "
"Then, you call the function like this: "
"<code>slidr_loop('your_loop_function')</code> Here is a simple example which "
"shows some youtube videos in a carousel:<br/><br/>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<code>\n"
"\t\t\t\t\tfunction my_loop() {<br/>\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t$myloop = array('n64TMQH0rxg', 'JwYX52BP2Sk', 'Ahr4KFl79WI', "
"'yFAnn2j4iB0', '6fMnF0Fvdpo', 'dFh71_ftxLE');<br/>\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t$output = '';<br/>\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\tforeach ($myloop as $item) {<br/>\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$output .= '&lt;div class=\"slidr-item\" style=\"height: 290px;"
"max-height: none;\"&gt;\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&lt;iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www."
"youtube.com/embed/' . $item . '\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;';<br/>\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t}<br/>\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\treturn $output;<br/>\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t}\n"
"\t\t\t\t</code><br/><br/>\n"
"\t\t\t\tAfter creating the above loop, you would call it like that: "
"<code>echo slidr_loop('my_loop');</code>. If you want to customize the "
"plugin's parameters, you have the following options available:<br/><br/>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<code>slidr_loop($loop, $height, $class, $cycle, $loader, $nav, "
"$larrow, $rarrow)</code>. Here's a detailed explanation of each parameter:"
"<br/><br/>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<ol>\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t<li><code>$loop</code>: Accepts a function (your custom loop). It "
"is the only required parameter in order for you to have a functional "
"carousel.</li>\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t<li><code>$height</code>: Accepts a string with a number. (e.g. "
"'500'). It sets the carousel's height.</li>\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t<li><code>$class</code>: Aceepts a string with your custom classes "
"(e.g. 'class-1 class-2'). If left empty, it defaults to 'default'. </li>\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t<li><code>$cycle</code>: Options include: true, false, 'auto', "
"'SPEED_NUMBER_IN_MS'. true enables cycling, 'auto' enables cycling AND auto "
"cycles the slides, 'SPEED_NUMBER_IN_MS' (e.g. '2000') enables cycling AND "
"ayto cycles the slides AND sets your custom cycling speed in ms. </li>\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t<li><code>$loader</code>: Options include: true, false, 'Your "
"custom text'. true enables the loader, false disables it and a custom string "
"(e.g. 'Loading slider...') enables the loader AND sets a custom text "
"message. </li>\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t<li><code>$nav</code>: If set to true or left empty it shows the "
"navigation arrows. If set to false it hides them.</li>\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t<li><code>$larrow</code>: Accepts a string to change the default "
"left arrow. You can add html, font icons, plain text or special characters.</"
"li>\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t<li><code>$rarrow</code>: Accepts a string to change the default "
"right arrow. You can add html, font icons, plain text or special characters. "
"</li>\n"
"\t\t\t\t</ol>\n"
"\t\t\t\tA full example would be something like that: <br/><br/>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<code>&lt;?php echo slidr_loop('my_loop', '500', 'myclass-1 "
"myclass-2', '2000', 'Loading videos...', true, 'previous', 'next'); ?&gt;</"
"code><br/><br/>\n"
"\t\t\t\tThe above would set the container height to 500px, add two custom "
"classes, set auto cycle with a speed of 2000ms, change the loader text and "
"change the navigation arrows.\n"
